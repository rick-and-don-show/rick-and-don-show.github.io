Rick kicks it off with his Jury Duty summons and missing out on talking about that last episode.  Detailing with even more agonizing detail, Rick spent some time in the Emergency Room and covers the ins & outs of Kidney Stones!  On happier topics, Don covers some of his recent video game playing and what the rest of his year looks like for big name titles!  Closing it out, both our hosts agree they'll be putting a lot of time into the upcoming Super Mario Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch!
