Another bonus episode this week is Don's Epic Comic-Con Attendance.  We cover Don's experience at the [Bull City Comicon](http://nccomicon.com/bull-city) in Durham, NC.  We close it out with some discussion on what we're watching... And as of today, that is [Marvel's Runaways](https://www.hulu.com/marvels-runaways) on Hulu!

Also, Don previews some blogging he'll be bringing to [rickanddon.com](http://rickanddon.com) as well, including [Donald Reviews Movies Poorly](http://rickanddon.com/tag/donald-reviews-movies-poorly/) and **Journey to Japan**.
