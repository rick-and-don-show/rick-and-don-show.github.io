Rick reports in from The Upside-Down on the Philadelphia Eagles winning Super Bowl 52.  Donald then confirms that Rick is not in The Upside-Down and that actually happened!  Our hosts then review the Super Bowl from different points of view, one from someone who actually watched it and one from someone who was just trying to survive it...

Closing out the episode, Rick and Don cover one of the top-five all-time Royal Rumble pay-per-views, including both a Men's and Women's Royal Rumble match.  Setting up plenty of storylines for 2018, this event had more than its share of surprises, shocks, and hi-points.

Finally, some additional blog series by Donald are live on our site, such as Game of the Year Reviews and Donald Reviews Movies Poorly.  Be sure to check out [rickanddon.com](http://rickanddon.com/tag/donald-reviews-movies-poorly/) for more details!
