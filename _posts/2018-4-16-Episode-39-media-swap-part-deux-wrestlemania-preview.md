We're finally back with the back half of our second (annual?) media swap... Rick returns with his experience with Sara Manguso's "The Two Kinds of Decay: A Memoir" and Don spills his feelings on Propaganda's most recent album, "Crooked".  Our hosts then close it out and wax poetically on what they hope for from Wrestlemania 34, what they know won't happen, and begin to doomsday prep for the rest of the WWE 2018 year.
