Lucky number 13 brings Rick and Don their first guest!  This week Chris Hendricks joins our hosts to talk about how Rick and Chris met, the definitions of geeks versus nerds, why being a nicer person is better for all of us, and... Aliens!  We barely scratch the surface this week with all the communal interests between the guys, so look for Chris to join us again very soon!  Check out Chris's wonderful projects & activities below.
