In the middle of an extended media swap, Don drops his knowledge on how to find a band's best stuff - both songs and sounds!  Rick and Don put this to the test across multiple genres to see where it succeeds and fails.  Once Don's theory is proven, our hosts then turn towards some of the recent and not-so-recent social issues that have been in the headlines.
