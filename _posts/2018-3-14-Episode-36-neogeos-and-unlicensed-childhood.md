After spending a week with his very own NeoGeo cabinet, Don catches us up on the pros and cons, the ins and outs, and the downright fun that comes with having a versatile arcade cabinet in your home. Rick then pivots to the ridiculousness of recent WWE bookings, including Brock Lesnar in Chicago. We close it out with a review of Don's experience at Raleigh Playthrough Gaming Convention, which then blows Rick's mind with an entrance into unlicensed video game clones... You need to hear this to believe!
