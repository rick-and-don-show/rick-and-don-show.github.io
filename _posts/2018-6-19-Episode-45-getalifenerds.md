We dive deep into the recent online controversies surrounding the Star Wars fandom and address some of the "ownership" issues from certain parts of the fandom.  An inclusive look at what can be done to rectify the need for tearing down art, how to appreciate other points of view, and the fact that everything is not made "just for you" has us talking much longer than anticipated - all for the better!!!
