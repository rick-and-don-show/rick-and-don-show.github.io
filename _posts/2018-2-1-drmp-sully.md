Clint Eastwood directs a movie where a pensive Tom Hanks thinks about flying a lot. Joining Hanks on this tale of non-flight is Aaron Eckhart's mustache, some poor CGI plane effects, and Katie Couric.  This film, for those of you that don't know is based a series of events that happened at the beginning of 2009. Which is a fact my mother reminded about several times when I told her that I watched this movie. I know Mom, I was alive, I saw all the news coverage because it was the only channel my TV would get in my dorm room. I lost the remote, no my roommate didn't lose it. That was years ago, I don't even have that TV anymore. Yes, I know they make universal remotes. And I don't need a haircut!

From what I can tell from Sully, the Miracle on the Hudson flight was about five minutes long including the crash.  Hanks and company conveniently fit five minutes of action into 96 minutes of run time. This movie struggles to find an antagonist to move the plot forward. From what I can tell there are several things out to take down the high flying Captain, like geese, a drinking problem that is brought up at the beginning of the film and never mentioned again, and some panel investigating why a seemingly functional plane found a new home in the Hudson River. There's a lot of manufactured tension between Sully and the panel investigating him.

Thank God for Aaron Eckhart backing up Captain Sully. A real modern day cowboy. Did I mention that Aaron Eckhart has a mustache in this movie? A stupid, sexy mustache, that never gets wet even though it is the co-pilot of a plane that crashed into the Hudson. Captain Sully overcomes computer simulations, and the trauma of the crash while being constantly bombarded by press outlets as he tours New York City.

For a movie that takes place in NYC, the background seems pretty light on diversity, it's like what I imagine a Nickelback concert looks like. I mean there some folks of color but, I swear in some scenes the camera actively runs away from them. Like in the very first scene of the movie there is a black guy on the panel, which is pretty cool, but he is never in frame, and what's even weirder, is that in coverage shots they block his face out, so some shots feel lopsided. It's almost the editor thought the audience can't handle both the trauma of a plane crash where everyone survived and be reminded that people of color live in New York. I guess they wanted to reduce the amount of potential trauma an audience member could experience, like if the last movie they watched about an aviation failure was Soul Plane. I suppose that makes sense, they did cast the affable Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart. They even went with an appropriate level of sass by casting Michael Rapport as a bartender and keeping his role small. 

In the end, I believe that captures the essence of Sully, a movie based on true events, sends it's target audience home happy, and features a mustache so glorious it should have gotten top billing over Tom Hanks.

**Rating: 3 mustache combs out of 5**
