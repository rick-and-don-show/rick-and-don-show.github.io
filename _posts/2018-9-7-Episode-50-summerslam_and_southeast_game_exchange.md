This week it's all about Don's excellent experience at Southeast Game Exchange and how he turned $20 into close to 30 games. Then we pivot into watching the wrestling show of the summer, SummerSlam... or so it was billed. There were some hits, there were some misses, but Rick & Don cover all of them.
