After a long summer break, our hosts reunite with a lot to catch up!  Don talks about his new-found obsession, Persona 5, and why it is definitely worth 100+ hours of your time.  Rick and Don then miraculously both end up watching different Dana Carvey specials and discuss the pros & cons (mostly cons) of each.  Finally, they circle back on one of the more popular topics, WRESTLING!!!, and talk about why everyone is now **15-time WWE world champion**!!!
