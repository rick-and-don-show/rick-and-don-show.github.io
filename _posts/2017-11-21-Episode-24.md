This week it's our Halloween episode!  Rick & Don cover their favorite Halloween costumes, some that were painstakingly hand-crafted and some that were worn after some very bad decisions.  Don then covers his year so far in video gaming and previews what he'll be covering in his "Gaming Year In Review".
