Kicking off the year, Rick and Don jump into what they did over their Christmas Vacation... somehow both of them ending up in vintage arcades and playing Japanese arcade machines!  Don's experience was a bit more fruitful than Rick's, but both our hosts had some interesting finds along the way.

Rick then covers his experience attending Smackdown Live! when the WWE was in town over Christmas.  Spoilers - somebody was bashed in the head with large wrapped Christmas presents...
