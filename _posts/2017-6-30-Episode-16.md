We're back after a bit of a hiatus!  Thanks to Rick's travel to GP Las Vegas and stupidly getting sick... But this week our guests cover the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in depth for what goodies are coming soon and how the show has changed since we were kids.  Rick then covers his Magic playing experience in Las Vegas and the hope for more of the same in the future!  Finally, Don circles back on one of his pre-reviews with some eyeballs-on experience for a movie screener!
