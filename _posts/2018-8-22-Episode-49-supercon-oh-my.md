This week we cover Don's Raleigh Supercon 2018 experience.  And he has a lot to say about it, including the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Don also ventured out to the Nippon Club of the Triangle's "NC Japan Summer Festival" in downtown Raleigh to much better results.  Rick and Don then close out the show by taking a walk down nostalgia lane and discussing all the old & current non-Magic trading card games they are playing or want to play.
