Our hosts circle back on their first annual event, the Magic The Gathering Modern Masters 17 price forecasting bonanza!  Covering 10 staples of eternal formats, Rick and Don predicted where these card prices would settle back in Episode 8.  Now 365(-ish) days later, after the dust has settled, we see just how accurate our hosts could be! The latter half of the episode covers one of Don's missed opportunities of his childhood, the chance to play DragonRaid with many of his young friends.  For those not in the know, DragonRaid is a full role-playing game system, based entirely upon the mythos of Christianity!
