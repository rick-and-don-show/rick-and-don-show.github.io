This week, Rick introduces Donald to the Enneagram and walks him through a quick test to discover his Enneagram type.  The Enneagram is "a model of the human psyche which is principally understood and taught as a typology of nine interconnected personality types." (per Wikipedia).  Per Rick, it is a wonderful way to understand your personality type further, why you do the things you do, why you react the way you do, and why you have the relationships that you have.  It's an insightful look into Donald's brain, so follow along for yourself and see how you map out!

The book referenced by Rick during this episode is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Enneagram-Definitive-Personality-Self-Discovery/dp/0062516760/) if you'd like to buy a copy and read your results at home!
