Welcome to our Thanksgiving episode!  Well, it's more of a Black Friday episode, but we're still talking turkey.  We kick it off with Don diving into his Pokemon Ultra Sun/Moon experiences, then re-previewing his Game of the Year research and festivities.  Then we jump into some deep reviews of Black Friday deals and bargains that our video game-focused listeners will not want to miss.
