You get a Neo-Geo! You get a Neo-Geo! Everyone get's a Neo-Geo! Well, at least Donald is getting one.  Our hosts open up about Donald's most recent find and Rick's pizza-flavored nostalgia around the multi-game arcade cabinet.  Then it's time for the in-depth and philosophical review of Marvel's The Black Panther.  Both our hosts end up going in a direction they didn't expect! Finally, Rick and Don wrap it up with some of the recent current events on the national stage that can't help but be addressed. Hoping for some common sense in government can't be too much to ask, can it? Can it?
