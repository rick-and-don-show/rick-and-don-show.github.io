Covering the nostalgia around snow days and the Winter Olympics, Rick and Don tackle much of their feel-good childhood Winter memories this week.  Along with discussing the trials & tribulations of personal growth, persistence, and experience, and how all of this helped to form our hosts as they are today.

Don also previews his excitement and plans for Raleigh's [Playthrough Gaming Convention](https://www.playthroughgc.com/), happening the weekend of February 17-18, 2018.
