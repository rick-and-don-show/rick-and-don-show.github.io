This week, it's all about cons! No, not Nic Cage or Sean Connery! Comic Conventions, also known as Cons! Rick covers his experience at this past weekend's C2E2 2017 in Chicago and compares it with past large Con experiences. Our hosts also dive into the drive to attend Cons and what is just so darn fun about them!
