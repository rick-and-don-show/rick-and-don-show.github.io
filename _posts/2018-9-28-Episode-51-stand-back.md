While Don preps for a hurricane with less than stellar enthusiasm, we chat up Don's recent viewing habits, including the underwhelming Hard Knocks, wrestling YouTube series, and nine-tenths of the new Marvel Cloak & Dagger series.  There's also plenty of wrestling coverage thrown in from Rick attending a night of Starrcast, the wrestling podcast convention that took place the same weekend as All In, the largest North American independent wrestling event in history!
