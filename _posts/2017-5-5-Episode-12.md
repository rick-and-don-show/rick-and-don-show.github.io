This week it's all about guests! We're planning some great stories with great friends, so we cover a bit of what we like about other podcasts and their guests.  Plus, we discover (while recording!) that we're live on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rick-don-show/id1229942938)... go check us out and subscribe!

Rick also surprises Don with a new game... Don't miss out on "Donald's Summer Movie Reviews," saving you time, money, and brain cells, all based on the IMDB tagline for the summer's hottest movies.
