This week it's all about guests! We're planning some great stories with great friends, so we cover a bit of what we like about other podcasts and their guests.

Rick also surprises Don with a new game... Don't miss out on "Donald's Summer Movie Reviews," saving you time, money, and brain cells, all based on the IMDB tagline for the summer's hottest movies.
