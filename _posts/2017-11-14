Presidential candidate, Will Conway, leads a group of reluctant heroes to fix the mistakes of Voila Davis.  Conway's Frank Underwood impression fails to rally his team the first couple times he performs it, but once Will Smith realizes that Conway, who is first introduced with a giant flag on his head, is prone to dying, he begrudgingly acknowledges that they will have to use teamwork to stay alive.  Strung throughout the movie, bits of cheese, I mean bits of character development are scattered and honestly, left me a bit confused.  I feel like I was supposed to understand both Harley Quinn and the Joker through those snippets of scenes, like the one where Harley Quinn dives into a vat of pancake batter to show her love for the Joker.  I get it, they are both kind crazy, but come on, did a movie about a group of people gathered together to fight super powered beings need a weird love story, how about two?  Maybe it did, I don't know.
