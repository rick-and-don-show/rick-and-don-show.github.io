Presidential candidate, Will Conway, leads a group of reluctant heroes to fix the mistakes of Viola Davis.  Conway's Frank Underwood impression fails to rally his team the first couple times he performs it, but once Will Smith realizes that Conway, who is first introduced with a giant flag on his head, is prone to dying, he begrudgingly acknowledges that they will have to use teamwork to stay alive.

Strung throughout the movie, bits of cheese, I mean bits of character development are scattered and honestly, left me a bit confused.  I feel like I was supposed to understand both Harley Quinn and the Joker through those snippets of scenes, like the one where Harley Quinn dives into a vat of pancake batter to show her love for the Joker.  I get it, they are both kind crazy, but come on, did a movie about a group of people gathered together to fight super powered beings need a weird love story, how about two?  Maybe it did, I don't know.   

But, what I do know, is that there are a lot of elements scrambled in here like eggs. Scrambled eggs and bacon, I could go for bacon. Or breakfast in general. Someone should write a movie where breakfast assembles like these super hero teams. The enemy could be like brunch foods or, I don't know maybe pop-tarts. I would watch that. I would also eat that.

Speaking of people who need eat, how come Will Smith couldn't get DJ Jazzy Jeff a role in this movie? It is clear that they needed the Fresh Prince to feel like the star of this film, even though this is supposed to be an ensemble cast. I mean Common is wasted in this movie, that could have been Jazzy Jeff. Ike Barinholtz is also in this movie. Was Aries Spears not available? How about Michael McDonald? I would have settled for Artie Lang. I miss MAD TV. I believe that sums up Suicide Squad, it leaves me wanting breakfast and missing MAD TV. 

**1.5 stars out of 5**
