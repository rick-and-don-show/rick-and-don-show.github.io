First and foremost, we ensure Don admirably survived Snowpocalypse II: The Return of Snowmageddon... or as the rest of the country would call it, some snow.  Then we get an update on Don's plans for traveling to Japan as a lead in to the bulk of our conversation.  Kicking that off, we have our (completely unsponsored) first mid-roll, where Rick discusses why you need to attend [Heart Camp](heartcampwithjamie.com).  Once they break it down, Rick and Don get into the rationalization of being a creative person, imposter syndrome, and breaking through your own mental gatekeeping.  This one is from the Heart, even if both our hosts reveal their Ravenclaw-ness at the end.
