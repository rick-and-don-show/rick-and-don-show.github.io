## The Podcast

In the fall of 2016, two friends, Rick and Don, decided they wanted to create something bigger than themselves. They decided to start a podcast. Every week, the pair tackle a topic ranging from the inane idiosyncrasies of nerd and pop culture to engaging, complex looks at art, technology, and the human experience. The two, from time to time,  dabble with the rose-colored substance known as nostalgia and discuss stories from the years of past.  Through their sharing of stories, discussions, moments of reflections, and a few jokes, both Rick and Don hope to show their listeners they aren't alone when they face challenges in their lives and their moments of happiness. Rick and Don just want to make the world a better place, no matter how small the impact.

## Rick

Rick has spent most of his life stuck behind a computer.  Using his Computer Science degree, that makes him pretty useful.

You could say he has too many hobbies.
